Steps to Use the code :

1. Commit all the files under Option2 folder in to Github repo along with  both Jenkinsfiles.

2. Enable Webhooks for the github, so that when ever a commit happens to the repository , Jenkins job will be run.

3. Configure 2 Multibranch pipeline Jobs in Jenkins .
a. Once to build a ECS cluster in AWS using Terraform using Jenkinsfile_terraform
b. Another to deploy docker application on to ECR cluster using Jenkinsfile

4.Build Triggers: Select option GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling. This will start our Jenkins job on every git push on the master branch for both the Jobs.

5. When ever a commit happens on github, Jenkins job start or we can run them manually.
a. We can run Jenkins job for terraform first to spin up the ECS cluster
b. We can run Jenkins job for the app deployment after the 1st Job.

6. Jenkinsfile for app deployment contains multiple steps which runs:

1. In checkout stage , clone the code on to the local.
2. In build stage, docker image is build and push to the repo.
3. In deploy stage , task definition file is updated with image and deployed to fargate.


7. Jenkinsfile for terraform deployment contains multiple steps which runs:

   1. In checkout stage , clone the code on to the local.
   2. In init step , we are initializing the the terraform modules.
   3. In plan step, we are kind of dry run to see what resources will be created.
   3. In apply stage, all the resources will be created.
